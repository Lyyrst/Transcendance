<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is the last one of the 42's Common Core, our first web project in a FullStack application.

- **Django** : API RESTful for the backend.
- **PostgreSQL** : database.
- **Docker** : Docker with django / postgres / nginx.
- **Pure JS Router** : SPA features re-write in a PURE JS, as a mini-Angular.

This project main difficulty is about creating a **Single Page Application whithout a framework**, so in PURE JS, without libraries also.
I make this with a friend to help me, available in the front/web/spa folder, who works as a mini-Angular, with service and components, and it's use by the application in front/web/app for the project.
